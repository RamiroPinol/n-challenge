### Steps to run the project

1. Clone the repository.
2. The backend uses Prisma and requires a MySQL database, make sure you have one running.
3. Create a .env file in the backend folder and add `DATABASE_URL`.

4. For both the backend and frontend, run `npm install` and then `npm start`.

Frontend will run on port 3000 and backend on port 4001.
